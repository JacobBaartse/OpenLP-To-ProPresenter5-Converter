# OpenLP to ProPresenter 5 converter

This is a quick fast converter from OpenLP's sqlite database to ProPresenter 5 XML files.

It works very fast, and does our 2800 song database in about 10 seconds.

Work in Progress, Please enjoy.

## Use:

Currently a bit basic.

Copy your songs.sqlite file into the same directory as this script, and run the script.

It will create all the XML files in /tmp/

On Mac, you can open /tmp/ with (in Finder) Menu->Go->Go To folder.

On Windows, you'll currently need to edit the simple.py file to make it point to somewhere sensible.


## TODO:

- Make it rugged
- Make it pretty
- Make a .app & .exe
- Make profit.
