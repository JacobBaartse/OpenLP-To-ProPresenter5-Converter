{"name":"OpenLP to ProPresenter5 converter","body":"### OpenLP to ProPresenter5 converter\r\nThis is a very simple python script to convert your OpenLP songs database to ProPresenter.  I wrote it as I couldn't get PP5 to import our songs from the text files OpenLP exported.\r\n\r\nIt also allows you to change the number of lines per slide, which actually means it may be quicker / easier if you need to change slide layout (in terms of how many lines per slide) to keep your song database in OpenLP, and export per event with the appropriate number of lines.\r\n\r\nIt runs fast, and does our 2700 song database (including Chinese, German and Japanese songs) in about 6 seconds on my iMac.\r\n\r\nTo use, just run the python script.  On OSX, Python is built in, which is helpful.\r\n\r\nIf you use a terminal, or want to edit stuff / check things / be geeky:\r\n```\r\ncd where_the_python_converter_file_is\r\npython converter.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Some options:\r\nIf you edit the script, you should be able to edit a bunch of options (number of lines per slide, default text color, default font, etc) at the top.  If it were really needed, more options could probably be added, but to be honest, this does most of what we need.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nIf you have questions, feel free to contact us at OMNIvision (http://www.omnivision.om.org).  We're the ones who wrote this quick script.\r\nIf you feel like donating to us, as we're a non-profit missions charity and all :-), then you can find more details on the website.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.omnitube.org/\r\nhttp://www.omnivision.om.org/\r\nhttp://www.om.org/","tagline":"A simple converter from OpenLP to ProPresenter5","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
